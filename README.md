ðŸš€ `ready` is a tool for developers to check how production ready their website.


## Usage

The simplest way to quickly check your site is with `uvx`:

```
uvx --from ready-check ready <domain>
```

Alternatively, install the tool from PyPI with:

```
pip install ready-check
```

Running the checks for a domain is as simple as:

```
ready <domain>
```

For more options, check the output of `--help`.


### Usage during development

If you have cloned the repository and would like to run the checks with your local version, simply run:

```
python3 -m ready.ready <domain> [--request-filter=<x>] [--check-filter=<x>]
```

### Optional Dependencies

There are no required dependencies, but two optional dependencies that enable some additional behaviour:

- Installing the `tld` package adds support for using the fully-qualified domain name for some DNS-related checks. This is handy if you want to check a subdomain.
- Installing `beautifulsoup4` adds support for extracting some headers from the HTML document as well as the headers. This technique can be used for sites that use static hosting like Github Pages.

Note: if you install from PyPI these dependencies are installed.
